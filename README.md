## About

This API enables users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on social networking data models using a NoSQL database. The data models encompass friends, users, thoughts, and reactions, which can be retrieved by ID or collectively. Constructed with Node.js and Mongoose, this API offers an uncomplicated and scalable solution for managing social networking data, unburdened by the constraints of conventional relational databases.
